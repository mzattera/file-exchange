# inspect_bill_tool.py
"""
Python translation of `com.infosys.small.pnbc.InspectBillTool`.

This tool is a specialised `LabAgent` that inspects a single task attachment
(supposed to be a bill/invoice) and decides whether a payment or reimbursement
should be executed, extracting relevant details as JSON.

Notes:
- Java Lombok-generated behaviours are ported explicitly.
- Field/method names follow Python conventions (snake_case) while JSON
  schemas use field aliases to preserve the original Java property names.
- Logging is implemented using Python's stdlib `logging`.
- @NonNull semantics are enforced via explicit checks where applicable.
